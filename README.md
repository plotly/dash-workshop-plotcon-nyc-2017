# Dash Workshop - Montréal ❄ February 2018

Syllabus for Montréal Dash Workshop, February 2018.

Dash is a new open source library for creating user interfaces in pure Python: no Javascript required. Dash allows you to bind interactive controls like sliders, dropdowns, and search boxes with interactive output widgets like graphs, tables, and text boxes.

This two day workshop will go over the foundations and guiding principles of dash, starting with simple examples on the first day and more advanced use cases on the second day. Each section of the Dash workshop will be focused around complete examples that the attendees can run on their own computers. Attendees will learn the principles of Dash by customizing these examples through gentle, interactive “challenges”. 
This workshop is taught by the author of the Dash library itself, with help from other Dash solutions experts at Plotly.
